# Case Study #3 - Foodie-Fi

## D. Outside The Box Questions
### 1. How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?
We can calculate the rate of growth for Foddie-Fi in term of customers and revenue. For customers, we can look at the increase rate of total active customers, customers upgrading/downgrading/cancelling after a trial or after using a subscription. In terms of revenue, we can compare the total revenue and profit of the current period with previous periods and of each type of plan.

### 2. What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?
* Regard number of customers: total active, increase rate, number of customers cancel/downgrade/upgrade
* Regard customers' experience: usage time per week, number of shows watched/interacted with, ratings of shows
* Regard revenue: total revenue per plan, gross of margin, effect of discount programs

### 3. What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?
* For new customers, we want to understand more details about their first impression through feedback surveys on the user interface, content quality, price plan, etc. Especially, when they cancel right after the trial, it's essential to find out why so we can know what aspect needs to be improved/modified.
* For regular customers, we should analyze their experience through metrics such as usage time, the number of shows watched/interacted with, and ratings of shows. In addition, we may periodically and randomly ask their opinions through surveys and social media to understand what they like/do not satisfy with our services and how likely they will recommend Foodie-Fi to friends or colleague.

### 4. If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?
1. How satisfied were you while using our product/service? (Rating, optional comment)
2. What is the reason for your cancellation? (multiple choices)
    * I am no longer interested in cooking shows.
    * The contents are limited/unattractive.
    * The app/website is lagging/bugging.
    * The app/website interface is difficult to use.
    * I'm using another streaming service.
    * Others, please tell us more...
3. Please tell us how we can do better. (Comment)
4. Do you still want to stay subscribed to our newsletter and promotion notice? (Yes/No)

### 5. What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?
To reduce the churn rate, Foodie-Fi team can consider:
* Collect customer feedback to understand more about their experiences/opinions and find solutions to improve our service
* Provide point-based loyalty programs / seasonal discount programs: to retain/attract loyal/new customers
* Increase customer engagement through app notification, mail, social network event, etc.

With each solution, it is important to specify the goal per period clearly at the start and evaluate key metrics (mentioned in Question 2) periodically to understand the effectiveness of each program.
